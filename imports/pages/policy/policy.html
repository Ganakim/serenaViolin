        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend you for your desire to learn a musical instrument and develop your abilities and skills. As a musician I hope you will find great fulfillment in music as you give your very best in developing your talents. Learning an instrument is not easy, but as you discipline yourself to learn and practice, it can help you to learn important skills, develop a greater appreciation for beauty, strengthen your character, and help you to become better prepared for your future. As a teacher I am pleased to have you as part of my music studio.

          <strong>Practice:</strong> Students are required to practice 6 days a week. I suggest every day except for Sunday. Consistent practice is crucial for progression in learning an instrument.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Listening:</strong> Students are required to listen to classical music every day. This can be done by listening to 89.1 FM, online, or by purchasing recordings. I also encourage students to listen to other genres of music. This will help the students develop musicality and a better knowledge of various music styles.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Punctuality:</strong> Being 5 minutes early to the lesson provides students with enough time to tune and prep before the lesson starts. It is a good way to maximize your lesson time as well as a good life habit to develop.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Materials needed:</strong> Students will need their own violin, bow, and other accessories as well as be required to purchase the necessary sheet music and books.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Parental responsibilities:</strong> Having parental support can greatly increase the student's speed of progress. Parents with children under 12 are strongly encouraged to attend each of the studentâ€™s lessons and to practice with and monitor home practice.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Cancellation process and Tuition:</strong> Tuition payment is due in full on the first lesson of the month. I will charge a flat rate month to month; however, missed lessons can be made up by contacting me and rescheduling.  Try to contact me as soon as possible to reschedule or cancel lessons. Makeup lessons are not offered if I am not contacted 24 hours in advance of the lesson time with the exception of illness or unexpected emergency.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Physical Contact:</strong> A limited amount of physical contact is often useful in teaching certain concepts about the proper posture of playing an instrument. If the student or parent have any concerns or dislike this way of teaching please let me know and I will limit my teaching to demonstrations and verbal communication.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Recital/Group classes:</strong> These are times for the student to be able to share what they've learned with their family and friends. The time for the events will be coordinated with currant students.
