            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having peer to peer encouragement greatly enhances students' musical experience and can be a great motivator. The group classes and recitals will give students' peer interaction as well as include music history and theory lessons. It will also be a time for students to perform for one another and give and receive feedback.
